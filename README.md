# Autonomous Mapping and Navigation
In one package I have kept both the autonomous mapping and navigation part. Slam toolbox, frontier search and obstacle avoider are used for autonomous mapping. Obstacle avoider isnt working properly, it needs tuning.
For navigation, RRT algorithm and pure pursuit used.
## Installation
```bash
cd ~/rosbot_ws/src/rosbot_ros
git clone 
```
